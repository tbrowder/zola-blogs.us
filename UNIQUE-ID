To satisfy my desire to have a unique order
of latest to earliest blogs, given multiple
users, I need to (1) establish a unique ID
for each post and (2) establish an immutable
record of the order of post submission.

+ Unique ID

The user names are already unique, and if
we use the author's time stamp for each
post and enforce its uniqueness, then
we are almost there.

The author's blog file name is in
format yyyy-mm-dd[a..zA..Z].md so, for author X
we have one or more unique IDs:

    2020-10-03.X
    2020-10-03a.X
    2020-10-03b.X

where

    2020-10-03a.X

is later than

    2020-10-03.X

+ Time ties for multiple authors

If two or more authors submit a post
on the same date, the order will be
determined by the value of
the internal "time: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mmZ"
value that is required for all posts on
the same day.

We keep a database of posts as they
are accepted and assign an order number
which establishes the immutable order.
The database entries will be:

  order  ID filename

where order starts with 1 and increments by 1
with each unique new ID entry.

The database will be a flat file until it
becomes large enough to look for another
solution.
