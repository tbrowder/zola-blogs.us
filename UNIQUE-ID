To satisfy my desire to have a unique order
of latest to earliest blogs, given multiple
users, I need to (1) establish a unique ID
for each post and (2) establish an immutable
record of the order of post submission.

+ Unique ID

The user names are already unique, and if
we use the author's time stamp for each
post and enforce its uniqueness, then
we are almost there.

The author's blog file name is in
format yyyy-mm-dd[.N] so, for author X
we have a unique ID:

    X-yyyy-mm-dd[.N].md

+ Immutable order

We keep a database of posts as they
are accepted and assign an order number
which establishes the immutable order.
The database entries will be:

  order  ID

where order starts with 1 and increments by 1
with each unique new ID entry.

The database will be an SQLite db using DB::SQLite
for the interface module.
