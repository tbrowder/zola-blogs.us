This page (the home or landing page) shows initial fragments of all
posts on the site.  Posts are shown in reverse date order (latest
first).  Following the date line is an optional line with an HTML
processing instruction whose contents are "lang:
SOME-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE".  This post is supposed to show a few lines
of text and end with a link to the complete post.
<? end-intro: blog ?>

Following is an example of Perl code highlighting with scheme
*solarized-dark*. See other available code highlighting schemes at this
[site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#syntax-highlighting)
(note not all links work to show examples of the highlighting).

Please suggest better alternatives to the chosen scheme.  (Raku syntax
highlighting is not yet available from Zola, but an issue has been filed with
the Zola repository.)

```perl
my $foo = 'foo';
say $foo;
