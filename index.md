This is a site for blog posts by
developers and programmers.

It is a work in progress, but the plan is to host 
my blogs plus those of others looking for a free
blog site. It runs on Github and its source
is in repo [github.com/tbrowder/zola-blogs.us](https://github.com/tbrowder/zola-blogs.us).

In spite of the domain, I welcome bloggers from
every nation. If you want to blog in another language
than English I will try to accomodate that
but I will have to find a Ralulang collaborator willing
to assist me in helping you.

Interested bloggers will have to check the "authors"
directory in the repo and pick a unique, short name
in ASCII chars for your site alias. In that file
please enter your real name. You can either add more
contact data you want to share with the world or,
as a minimum, send a valid email to me at my
CPAN address. See the "authors/tbrowder"
file for an example.

Those wanting to add a blog here will have the
choice of sending me your article, in Markdown 
format, to [tbrowder@cpan.org](mailto:tbrowder@cpan.org) or 
forking the repo and submitting
a PR.

The domain name comes from [Zola](https://getzola.org), the static
website generator. (Its original name was
*Gutenberg*.)
