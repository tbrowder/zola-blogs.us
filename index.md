This is a site for blog posts by
developers and programmers.

It is a work in progress, but the plan is to host 
my blogs plus those of others looking for a free
blog site. It runs on Github and its source
is in repo [github.com/tbrowder/zola-blogs.us](https://github.com/tbrowder/zola-blogs.us).

Those wanting to add a blog here will have the
choice of sending me your article, in Markdown 
format, to [tbrowder@cpan.org](mailto:tbrowder@cpan.org) or 
forking the repo and submitting
a PR.

The domain name comes from [Zola](https://getzola.org), the static
website generator. (Its original name was
*Gutenberg*.)
